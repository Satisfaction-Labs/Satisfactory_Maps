Overview: Track v2 is the second track i made it just started as a big jump off top of the BIG n rock landing into a big wall climb circle going down ward then slowly adding additional sections.

Its an open world course.

Everything was done in EARLY ACCESS and very little infastructure to keep the frame rate high, so alot of hand crafting was done!
there is one area that splits the track into 3 its a meh im not going to fix it, im just gonna make a new track when U3 comes out.

Notes: Don't Forget to get the jet pack out of storage at start ramp!

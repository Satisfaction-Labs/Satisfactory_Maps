# Adding A Map
* You will need to contact one of the Satisfaction Labs moderators to grant you permission to this GitHub repository
* Create a folder for your map
  * Please don't name it like AAA_something so it appears at the top, we'll simply delete it
* Use the README.md file in AAA_EXAMPLE as your template
* Add some screenshots as well so people know what they are expecting
* You can add multiple save files for the same map if you feel like it's necessary
  * Please don't add different maps in the one folder

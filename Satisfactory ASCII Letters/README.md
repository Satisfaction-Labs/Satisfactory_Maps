Overview: A map containing almost all ASCII symbols that can be created in a vanilla game - including support layout to help you create your own signage

Notes: There are a number of symbols that are duplicates or extremely similar to existing symbols which have been ommitted, and others that are currently not possible in Vanilla, feel free to come up with your own methods and share with me @dontpokejosh - I hope to revisit this again and make use of these letters for a bigger project.

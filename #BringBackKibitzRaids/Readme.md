Overview: A map built in EA U3 with a sign of pipes spelling #BringBackKibitzRaids in the form of linked chains. Blueprints also are provided so you can paste them into your map using Satisfactory Calculator.

Notes: Kibitz tells his viewers that he no longer raids on Twitch due to a bad experience he had when raiding SMERKIN 5000. Since then he no longer performs any raids (so I am told), I want to encourage Kibitz to resume raids. The viewers are the ones that are missing out here, streaming is all about the viewers #ViewerRightsMatter.

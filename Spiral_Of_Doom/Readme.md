Overview: Three versions of the Spiral of Doom roullette wheel of death. 1/6, 1/3, 1/2 chance of death 

Notes: you will need to kill my avatar when you first load up the game to steal some tasty fuel and jetpack power. 
To change the odds you will need to adjust the pipes in NOODLE mode at the very top of the spiral of doom, 
The high exits = survive, Low exits = death.

Everyone has 2 lives at full health, if you want to give them only one life you will need to take them down to 1 heart
